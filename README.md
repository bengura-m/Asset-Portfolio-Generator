## About The Page ## 
We created an application that when l open the app, I am presented with a selection of conservative, balanced or aggressive risk tolerance options;
If l know my risk tolerance, I select an option that aligns with my risk tolerance and l am presented with stocks that align my risk profile; 
If l don’t know my risk profile, I select the option to participate in a quiz that is designed to determine my risk tolerance based on a set of carefully selected questions and a set algorithm; 
Once my risk tolerance is determined from quiz, I am presented with a selection of stocks that align my risk profile;
When l click on each stock suggestion, I am presented with top news stories about my recommended stocks;
